## Getting started

1. Clone your repo (or download site files) to local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd your-project-folder
   <!-- gallery.html -->
<div class="gallery-grid">
  <figure class="gallery-item">
    <img src="/pic/Koraput-01.png" alt="Deomali Peak">
    <figcaption>Deomali — Odisha's highest peak</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="gallery-item">
    <img src="/pic/Duduma.png" alt="Duduma Waterfall">
    <figcaption>Duduma Waterfall</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- add more figures -->
</div>

If you want, I can:
- generate a ready `gallery.html` file with a lightbox and responsive layout that uses the `assets/images/` folder; or
- create optimized photo filenames and an `assets/images.zip` you can download (I’ll need you to upload the photos or confirm you want sample placeholders).

Which of those next steps do you want?
